You know [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), right?

And the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)?

Have you actually *read* the paper that introduced it,

[Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/471/papers/turing.pdf)?

*No?!*

You… you are not prepared.

For instance: "Writing a good song is not mimicry, or replication, or pastiche, it is the opposite. […] It is the breathless confrontation with one’s vulnerability, one’s perilousness, one’s smallness, pitted against a sense of sudden shocking discovery; it is the redemptive artistic act that stirs the heart of the listener, where the listener recognizes in the inner workings of the song their own blood, their own struggle, their own suffering."
