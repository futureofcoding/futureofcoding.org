# Building for Developers: Aidan Cunniffee

_02/01/18_

Aidan Cunniffe is the founder and former CEO of Dropsource, the no-code mobile development platform. He is now working on a new company to make developers more productive, Optic. In this episode, we discuss the trade-offs between creating tools for developers vs non-programmers. We also get to hear some of the upcomming features to expect from Optic. We finish off the interview with a fun theoretical discussion of notation, representation, conciseness and learnability.
