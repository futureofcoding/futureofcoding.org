"[Is the whole universe a computer?](https://marksprevak.com/pdf/paper/Sprevak---The%20Computable%20Universe.pdf)", ask Jack Copeland, Mark Sprevak, and Oron Shagrir in chapter 41 of the book [The Turing Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turing_Guide). They split this question in two, first asking whether the universe itself is a computer, then whether the universe could even be computed. These are lofty, unanswerable questions, sure, but they encroach on *our* territory — philosophy, automata, nonsense. So, in our usual reverent style and with attentive pacing, the three of us explore the paper, the questions, the answers they choose to highlight, and even share a few perfectly reasonable answers of our own.
