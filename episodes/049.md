Back in the previous life, I sent a link to slides that present an overview of several ideas behind Sketch-n-Sketch. In case you think it would be useful as a link, here is something similar but in text form (this "research statement" is part of a tenure review file that I just submitted):

I forget whether we talked about plans to teach a new Creative Coding class, but now it's official and slated to start next spring.
