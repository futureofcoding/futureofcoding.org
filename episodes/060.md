Before the time-travelling talks, the programmable rooms, the ladders and rocket launchers, we had the first real Bret Victor essay: [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/). It set the stage for Bret's later explorations, breaking down the very idea of "software" into a few key pieces and interrogating them with his distinct focus, then clearly demoing a way we could all just _do it better_. All of Bret's works feel simultaneously like an anguished cry and a call to arms, and this essay is no exception.

For the next episode, we're reading _Programming as Theory Building_ by Peter Naur, with a little bit of Gilbert Ryle's _The Concept of Mind_ thrown in for good measure.

Jimmy's Fender Jazz bass [looks like this](https://www.fender.com/en-US/electric-basses/jazz-bass/player-jazz-bass/0149902506.html), but red, but like a decade older, but like $600 at the time.

We could probably post parts of this episode as [Boyfriend Roleplay](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=boyfriend+roleplay) on YouTube.

[Fitts's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law) is but one thing we've learned about the industrial design aspect of building good software.

[The Witness](http://the-witness.net) is a game where communicating ideas through (essentially) graphic design is the *whole entire point* of the game. If you haven't played it, know that it comes highly recommended by plenty of folks in the community.

A "red letter Bible" is a Bible in which the words spoken by Jesus are colored red, to make them easier to identify.

Toph Tucker has a pretty cool [personal website](https://www.tophtucker.com). It's rare to see these sorts of sites nowadays, and they're always made by adventuresome programmers, trendy design agencies, or their clients. In the Flash era, it felt like *everyone* had a website like this, for better and for worse.

[tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) is a beautiful little browser-based [drawing tool](http://tldraw.com) by [Steve Ruiz](https://www.steveruiz.me). What few things it does, it does exceptionally well.

[#devlog-together](https://feelingofcomputing.slack.com/archives/C03RR0W5DGC) is the channel on our Future of Coding slack community where members post small, frequent updates about what they're working on.

The [(Not Boring)](https://www.andy.works) apps are arguably a counterpoint to Bret's theses about information apps and harmful interaction, where the interaction and graphic design are balanced against being maximally-informative, toward being silly and superfluous, to great effect.

Did you know there's a [hobby horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_horse_(toy)), but also a [hobby horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_horse)? I didn't!

There are a few examples of folks doing FoC work that, in Ivan's view, align well with the values Bret outlines in Magic Ink:
* [Szymon Kaliski](https://szymonkaliski.com)'s projects for [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com), summarized in his Strange Loop talk, [Programmable Ink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifYuvgXZ108).
* [Mock Mechanics](https://mockmechanics.com) is an environment for building mechanisms by [Felipe Reigosa](https://github.com/felipereigosa).
* [PANE](https://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane/) by [Josh Horowitz](https://joshuahhh.com/) inverts the usual node-wire programming pattern by putting data in the nodes and data transformation in the wires.

[Robot Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Odyssey) was a 1984 game for the Apple II (and some other, lesser systems) in which players would go inside various robots to reprogram them.

Music featured in this episode:
* Wash Machine, from the [unfinished](https://ivanish.ca/sneaky-dances/) 2014 album [Sneaky Dances](https://spiralganglion.bandcamp.com/album/sneaky-dances)
* [Shaun's Amaj Rebirth](http://ivanish.ca/shauns-amaj-rebirth), created in November 2022 for a friend named — you guessed it — Shaun.
