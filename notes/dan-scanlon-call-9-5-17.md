# Dan Scanlon Call 9/5/17


* Listened to a few of my podcasts while on a long drive!

* Used to work at TabTour, now call Thinkster math
  * got excited about Bret Victor here
  * "Netflix for worksheets"
    * they aren't leveraging their medium (iPad) as much as possible 


* Now works at Analytical Flavor System
  * describe flavor profiles
  * sell the insights to food and beverage companies
  * friends of his, from Penn State, hung out at hackathons
  * leaving now, because of a cash crunch


* Futurism
  * also his friend Alex and his friend Jordan
  * just made him a large offer to be head of engineering
  * media company, including blog
  * make investments and do new product development
  * thesis: "stuff that represents the future"
  * started two years ago
  * it's grown really fast
  * by using anaytics
  * have audience of several million
  * they started gravity blanket


* His past future of programming research
  * GraphQL + Datomic
  * React Native WYSIWYG


* In free time, future of programming research
  * Bret Victor, stop drawing dead fish, and dynamic visualizations
    * funciton out of sequences through interactions with canvas
      * start with line
      * manipulate that line
    * TODO send him aprt.us
    * new reframing
      * types as shapes makes things more intuative
        * he wasnts to think about types as spaces
          * boolean is a number line, but only at 0 or 1
          * analytical flavor system flavor profile is 24-dimensional space, where each scalar is represented 1-5
        * interact with something in space
          * that interaction turns into a series of frames
          * "moving a fish vertically up will cause one frame be to created"
          * "how do I animate moving the fish up?"
            * loop the sequence so that last position of the fish is the new origin
    * FramerJS
      * constrast: it's not UI-data-binding, because the thing you're interacting with in the canvas is not neccesarily a visual output
        * can visualize any Abstract Data Types
    * example app
      * move your finger across screen and get different wave sounds   
      * 1. create touch event sequence
      * 2. put circle on screen in corner
      * 3. draw a line to it from the x-axis and y-axis
      * 4. label the value of the magnitue of those lines
      * 5. map the value of these values to the speaker
  * doing this research in his free time
    * restraining himself from coding it himself
    * trying to think it out in his head, hypothetically
    * TODO Elliot Conal denotational design

* Get his feedback on my research
  * StreamSheets
    * The inspiration of his project (Aberration) is in order to have a truly powerful system, you have to be able to manipulate the lower levels of a system within that system so you can "lift the hood"
      * Related to Alan Kay STEPS
    * Thinking about the complex pieces of data that will push the boundaries of your interface
      * Visualizing nested objects, for example, was hard in a prior prototype of his but will be better in Aberration
        * TODO ask if he has picture of Aberration
    * If you're trying to make a game
      * you have x-position and y-position


* TODO add to slack group
