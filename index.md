title: Future of Coding Research Archive
---

This is an archive of research notes by [Steve Krouse](https://stevekrouse.com) circa 2017-2019, around the time that he founded the Future of Coding slack community and podcast. In late 2019, Steve stepped away from the community to put his research ideas into practice. He founded the startups Compose, Zaplib, and most recently [Val Town](https://www.val.town). The community and podcast have grown and changed too, and are now known as the [Feeling of Computing](https://feelingof.com).

This archive is a work-in-progress, with minimal navigation. To see the full collection of notes, explore the [repository](https://github.com/futureofcoding/futureofcoding.org).
