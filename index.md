**Feelings of Computering** is an online community with a welcoming, cooperative, and revolutionary spirit. We are unified in the belief that the computer is tragically less humane than it could be. There's a world of possibilities that get more beautiful the further away from the norm you go. We're here to explore this world together, to discuss ideas about theory and practice, and to champion and support our members' research and development efforts to _reimagine the computer_.

(Editor's note: the original name of this community was "Future of Coding", but that name is bad so we [changed it](/the-name).)

<br>

### Community

We share ideas, prototypes, weekly videos, and inspirational links, with a friendly tone and an inclusive [code of conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct). You are heartily encouraged to [join](/community).


<br>

### Meetups

Our members organize meetups and events in cities around the world and online. The [London](https://lu.ma/foclondon) meetup is especially popular and deserves special mention.

<br>

### Podcast

There's a [podcast](/episodes), too. It's grown and changed quite a bit over the years. Presently, hosts [Ivan Reese](https://ivanish.ca), [Jimmy Miller](https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/), and [Lu Wilson](https://todepond.com) share notable and notorious works from across the history of our field, with one eye on philosophy and frequent diversions into the absurd. Listen in your podcast player by searching for the old name **Future of Coding**, or via [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/future-of-coding/id1265527976) \| [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes1265527976) \| [RSS](https://omny.fm/shows/future-of-coding/playlists/podcast.rss) and if you feel so inclined, [become a supporter](https://www.patreon.com/futureofcoding) to access bonus content and warm fuzzy feelings.

The most recent episode is: [75 • A Case for Feminism in Programming Language Design by Felienne Hermans](/episodes/075)

<br>

### Wiki

Just launched — we now have a [wiki](https://wiki.futureofcoding.org) that anyone can edit. It's a place to organize the links and projects and ideas amassed during our Slack discussions. The project is still very (very) young, so please share your desires and frustrations on the Slack in #present-company.

<br>

### Newsletter

Want to follow the ongoing work and interesting finds of the community, without being tied to Slack? We have a [weekly newsletter](https://newsletter.futureofcoding.org/) that allows you to follow along from the comfort of your inbox. It features popular links shared by community members, the most interesting discussions, updates on our projects and research, and other highlights.

<br>

### Collaboration

Our members are working together to bring about a futuristic vision of computing, and you can help — or get help with your own futuristic project. Our [collaboration](/collaboration) page collects projects that are on-the-go in our community, and resources to help folks combine their efforts.

<br>

### Catalog

One of our special projects is the [Whole Code Catalog](/catalog), a collection of detailed reviews of 24 programming-ish interfaces and experiments.

<br>

### About

The community was originally founded by [Steve Krouse](https://stevekrouse.com), and you can read a lot more about his ideas and research [here](/about). The current steward of the community is [Ivan Reese](https://ivanish.ca). Thanks to Kartik, Mariano, Jimmy, Lu, and Ibro for their help.

If you'd like to read up a bit on the ideas our community was formed around, [Chris Novello's _Computer Utopias_ curriculum](http://chrisnovello.com/teaching/risd/computer-utopias/) (particularly Week 3 & 4) and [The New Media Reader](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-media-reader) are fantastic resources. Fancy a video? This [Alan Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYT2se94eU0) talk is foundational.
