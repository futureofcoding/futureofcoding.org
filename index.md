> Are you looking for the _real_ computer revolution? Join the club!

**Future of Coding** is an online community with a welcoming, cooperative, and revolutionary spirit. We are unified in the belief that the common practice of programming is tragically less humane than it could be. There's a world of possibilities that get more beautiful the further away from the norm you go. We're here to explore this world together, to discuss ideas about theory and practice, and to champion and support our members' research and development efforts to _reimagine computing_.

<br>

### Community

The hub of our discussions is [our Slack community](/community). We share ideas, prototypes, weekly videos, and inspirational links, with a friendly tone and an inclusive [code of conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct). We also organize meetups and events in cities around the world and online. You are heartily encouraged to join.

<br>

### Podcast

We have a podcast, too. It features interviews with toolmakers, researchers, computational artists, and others with fruitful viewpoints on what the future of computing holds. Check out the [episode archive](/episodes).

### Newsletter

Want to follow the ongoing work and interesting finds of the community, without being tied to Slack? We have a [weekly newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/marianoguerra/archive) that allows you to follow along from the comfort of your inbox. It features popular links shared by community members, the most interesting discussions, updates on our projects and research, and other highlights.

### Catalog

One of our special projects is the [Whole Code Catalog](/catalog), a collection of detailed reviews of 24 programming-ish interfaces and experiments.

### About

The community was originally founded by [Steve Krouse](https://stevekrouse.com), and you can read a lot more about his ideas and research [here](/about). The current steward of the community is [Ivan Reese](https://ivanish.ca).

If you'd like to read up a bit on the ideas our community was formed around, [Chris Novello's _Computer Utopias_ curriculum](http://chrisnovello.com/teaching/risd/computer-utopias/) (particularly Week 3 & 4) and [The New Media Reader](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-media-reader) are fantastic resources. Fancy a video? This [Alan Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYT2se94eU0) talk is foundational.

On GitHub, you can find and contribute to [this website](https://github.com/stevekrouse/futureofcoding.org) and a handful of [community resources](https://github.com/futureofcoding).

See you in the future!
