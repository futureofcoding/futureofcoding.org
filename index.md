**Future of Coding** is an online community with a welcoming, cooperative, and revolutionary spirit. We are unified in the belief that the common practice of programming is tragically less humane than it could be. There's a world of possibilities that get more beautiful the further away from the norm you go. We're here to explore this world together, to discuss ideas about theory and practice, and to champion and support our members' research and development efforts to _reimagine computing_.

<br>

### Community

We share ideas, prototypes, weekly videos, and inspirational links, with a friendly tone and an inclusive [code of conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct). We also organize meetups and events in cities around the world and online. You are heartily encouraged to [join](/community).

<br>

### Podcast

We have a [podcast](/episodes), too. It's grown and changed quite a bit over the years. Presently, hosts [Jimmy Miller](https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/), [Ivan Reese](https://ivanish.ca), and [Lu Wilson](https://todepond.com) share notable and notorious works from across the history of our field, with one eye on philosophy and frequent diversions into the absurd. Listen in your podcast player by searching for **Future of Coding**, or via [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/future-of-coding/id1265527976) \| [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes1265527976) \| [RSS](https://omny.fm/shows/future-of-coding/playlists/podcast.rss) and if you feel so inclined, [become a supporter](https://www.patreon.com/futureofcoding) to access bonus content and warm fuzzy feelings.

### Newsletter

Want to follow the ongoing work and interesting finds of the community, without being tied to Slack? We have a [weekly newsletter](https://newsletter.futureofcoding.org/) that allows you to follow along from the comfort of your inbox. It features popular links shared by community members, the most interesting discussions, updates on our projects and research, and other highlights.

<br>

### Collaboration

Our members are working together to bring about a futuristic vision of computing, and you can help — or get help with your own futuristic project. Our [collaboration](/collaboration) page collects projects that are on-the-go in our community, and resources to help folks combine their efforts.

<br>

### Catalog

One of our special projects is the [Whole Code Catalog](/catalog), a collection of detailed reviews of 24 programming-ish interfaces and experiments.

<br>

### About

The community was originally founded by [Steve Krouse](https://stevekrouse.com), and you can read a lot more about his ideas and research [here](/about). The current steward of the community is [Ivan Reese](https://ivanish.ca). Thanks to Kartik, Mariano, Jimmy, Lu, and Ibro for their help.

If you'd like to read up a bit on the ideas our community was formed around, [Chris Novello's _Computer Utopias_ curriculum](http://chrisnovello.com/teaching/risd/computer-utopias/) (particularly Week 3 & 4) and [The New Media Reader](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-media-reader) are fantastic resources. Fancy a video? This [Alan Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYT2se94eU0) talk is foundational.
