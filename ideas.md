# Research Ideas

## Problems to solve

* it's so hard to get a sense of a project via the folders and files abstraction

* higher-order functions are tricky to understand

* it's difficult to keep track of the specific problem we're working on and how it pertains to the larger goal

* version control of firebase, for development, rollbacks

## Ideas to solve them

* streams as spreadsheets
  * http://futureofcoding.org/journal#streams-as-spreadsheets
  * http://futureofcoding.org/journal#streams-as-spreadsheets-2
  * http://futureofcoding.org/journal#august-25-2017-757pm
  * http://futureofcoding.org/journal#august-28-2017-228pm

* mock up what it would look like to have **layers** as the core computational abstraction, allowing users to peak under the hood of their apps, change things, and submit pull requests without leaving the app. 
  * http://futureofcoding.org/journal#layers-as-functional-abstraction

* continue researching types-as-shapes, potentially even building a prototype

* build a generic expression building widget/library (google sheets formulas but without syntax errors)

* build a Workflowy-like work planning and branching tool (potentially for woofjs.com)
  * http://futureofcoding.org/journal#workflowy-git

* reactive game engines
  * make a reactive WoofJS
    * http://futureofcoding.org/journal#reactive-woofjs
  * make a game engine with an aprt.us interface
    * http://futureofcoding.org/journal#aprtus-like-interface-as-game-builder
  * make an Elm game engine
    * http://futureofcoding.org/journal#elm-game-engine

* can we combine strong types + macros to get natural language coding or less stack overflow?

* essay about why we should stop teaching for loops in favor of forEach loops and while loops (is this how python works already?)

* essay about the flexbox block in cycle v2
  * what would a "Turing-complete" layout engine look like? (in the sense that SQL is a Turing-complete query langauge)

* continue working on Cycle v2 w/o VueJS (and maybe without Blockly)

* continue working on Rose v1 with text as UI

* work on a Lamdu- or Unison- like structured editor for the web
